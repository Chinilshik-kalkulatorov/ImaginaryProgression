# ImaginaryProgression
## Basic Complex Number Operations with Checkmarks and Crosses

This project contains Python code for performing basic operations with complex numbers using NumPy. The user can input the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers from the keyboard. The script also provides the results of various operations.

## Operations Included

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Magnitude
6. Conjugate

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chinilshik-kalkulatorov/ImaginaryProgression.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ImaginaryProgression
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python complex_operations.py
    ```

5. Follow the prompts to input the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers. The script will then display the results of various operations.

## Example

After running the script, you will be prompted to enter the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. The script will then display the results of various operations.

### Sample Input
```
Enter the first complex number:
Enter the real part: 1
Enter the imaginary part: 2

Enter the second complex number:
Enter the real part: 3
Enter the imaginary part: 4
```

### Sample Output
```
Complex number 1: (1+2j)
Complex number 2: (3+4j)

Addition (c1 + c2): (4+6j)
Subtraction (c1 - c2): (-2-2j)
Multiplication (c1 * c2): (-5+10j)
Division (c1 / c2): (0.44+0.08j)
Magnitude of c1 (|c1|): 2.23606797749979
Magnitude of c2 (|c2|): 5.0
Conjugate of c1: (1-2j)
Conjugate of c2: (3-4j)
```
